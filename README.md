# Library-System
Book Library System: A simple web app to manage a book library. Users can add books with validation (name, price, author info), avoid duplicates, and get email suggestions while typing. The form hides when the book limit is reached and reappears if a book is removed. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
