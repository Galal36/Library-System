# Book Library System

This project is a simple web-based application for managing a book library. Users can add books to the library, specifying the book name, price, author name, and author email. The application validates the input to ensure correctness and prevents duplicate entries. Additionally, it suggests previously entered email addresses as the user types. The form hides automatically when the maximum number of books specified is reached, and reappears if a book is deleted.
